# Android Microphone

Use your Android phone as a microphone to Windows PC

------

### Requirements  
* Android phone with bluetooth  
* Windows PC with bluetooth  
* PC and phone are paired once  
* Installed [Virtual Audio Cable (VAC)](https://vac.muzychenko.net/en/) on Windows, will hear "trial" voice if your driver is in trial mode  
  I'm actually using [VB-Audio](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) as alternative now since it is completely free

### How to use  

1. Run Windows side application first, click `connect` to start server  
2. Next launch Android side application, click `connect` and enable `microphone`  
3. Select audio speaker from drop down list to the one that VAC (or VB) created
